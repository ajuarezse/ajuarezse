<p align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Angel Juarez — a full-stack developer who pivoted into tech to build tools that are thoughtful, useful, and human-centered.

Here on GitHub, you'll find the projects I'm actively building and learning from — many of which reflect my interest in clean, modern UI, React development, and backend integration with Node and Express.

I'm especially excited about projects that explore how software can empower communities and make everyday tasks simpler.
